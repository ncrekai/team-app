## Hi
I uploaded my Assignment 2 MERN Portfolio submission with most of the content pages removed from client-site. 

Backend stuff that needs to be added:
- authentication/authorization
- redo config.js file to match new group db collection
- redo API calls once we figure out project details


### Other than that I *think* this should be fine as a base to build the rest of the project on
